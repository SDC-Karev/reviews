How review sentiment is calculated

The db is seeded with a biased function that produces more positive than negative ratings.  Below is a sample set of 20 games and their positive/negative review counts.
game_id	  positive	  negative	  total       positivity %

Missing or incomplete funtionality

Functionality: awards buttons
What's missing: can't give awards to reviews
Reason: we do not currently have the concept of a logged in user with a user id.  In order to attach an award to a review, a user id must be associated with that award.

Functionality: awards widgets
What's missing: Widgets for each award type (thumbs up for yes, down for no, smiley for funny, and custom awards widgets)
Reason: Time constraints

Functionality: filter capabilities
What's missing: can't see filter dropdowns or select filters
Reason: time constraints for the project

Functionality: load more reviews
What's missing: button to load more reviews at bottom of Helpful Reviews section
Reason: time constraints for the project

Functionality: review author profile
What's missing: link to author profile, author avatar
Reason: time constraints for the project

Functionality: helpful reviews initial filtering
What's missing: only pulling reviews sorted by helpful votes, ignoring date constraint
Reason: this is fake data and to the most 'helpful' reviews, skipping over date filtering here

Functionality: helpful award tally
What's missing: this should probably be calculated by subtracting the helpful count from the unhelpful count in the reviews_awards table.
Reason: Again, because this is fake data, it's simplified to show actual votes

Functionality: tooltips
What's missing: pretty much any tooltip describing ratings or how they're calculated
Reason: Time constraints
